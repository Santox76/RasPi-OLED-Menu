# RasPi-OLED-Menu
Python3 Code to controll Mopidy/MPD with an OLED display and an rotary encoder connected to a raspberry pi

**Currently under development!**

This code is for a homemade internet radio.
It is based on a Raspberry Pi Zero W with a USB sound card.
It is not only controlled via a web interface, but also via a small OLED display and a rotary encoder.
There should be a menu to navigate through with the rotary encoder.
The display has a sh1106 chip.
